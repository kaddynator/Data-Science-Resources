MentalHealth	I keep thinking about ways to go and ease this pain, I feel so bad for feeling so lonely and not being independent enough to be able to do this alone but I won’t go back to my job until next month and need to be in the right environment with friends and love and support to get through this but it is so hard

MentalHealth	Even if I had no financial problems and the motivation to change my life, it would still take me years to get to a comfortable place and I know I can't take that anymore.  Anyway, I already realized I'm way beyond the point of no return and I saved up money to buy a gun for a fast painless death. The urge to kill myself has been pretty high these days and I think I'm finally so close to it.
MentalHealth	I’m just so tired now, I’m just finishing my finals so my mom doesn’t suspect anything. When I’m finished with school, I’ll finally be free. It’s been more than a decade, I’m now 20 years old.  I’m tired.
MentalHealth	I have been thinking of trying to call one because I feel really suicidal and unsafe with myself, but I can’t see the point. In the past, when I have called, all they do is mirror you and ask open questions. “Wow, it sounds like things are really hard for you right now, what are some things that you think would make living seem worthwhile?” That kind of thing. Like, no fucking shit, things are hard right now. If I knew what would make life seem worthwhile, I wouldn’t want to call you or kill myself. It’s the same for every mirror/question they throw at you. Does anyone know why they’re like this? It always seems so fake and scripted.

Harassment/Abuse	I’m a 18 year old male and I work at the mall and there’s this guy that always comes in and talks to one of my coworkers and he talks like your typical Cali surfer weed smoker. So my coworker kinda just teases him but the guy doesn’t realize we’re doing it and he thinks we’re being his close friend. So I started to join in the chat everytime he came into the store and I he asked for my number cause he thought I was “cool” so I gave it to him and then he started to text me. (This is where it starts to go down hill) so at first he just wanted to my number cause he wanted to see if we had deals in my store but eventually he started texting me and I would barely reply with a “yea” or “ok” then when I would take about 10 minutes to reply he would spam me with 9 or 10 messages saying “you there bro?” Or “are you ignoring me” I didn’t wanna be rude so I just said I was doing something. So I told my coworkers to tell him I don’t work at the mall anymore. So he would stop coming by. Today he came in and my friend told him that I got fired or something and then my coworkers told me that if he finds out I still work there he’ll be pissed and that I put my self in a bad situation. Which I agree I did. So I texted him today saying that my friend was joking with him and he was cool about it but then he said he hated the coworker that told him I got fired. I told him he was just joking and he said okay. So basically idk how to stop being friends with this guy cause if he finds out I’m ignoring him he’ll hurt me. (Btw this guy is pretty strong and buff.) so idk what to do know and now I look so stupid in front of my coworkers and I’m so stupid for putting my self in a bad situation I fucking hate myself and wanna kill my self. I go in tomorrow and my coworkers are gonna think of me as a fucking idiot. Fuck my life. I just don’t know how to handle this situation. If this didn’t make sense lmk. If you made it this far thanks I appreciate at least someone seeing this.

MentalHealth	My depression has been doing so good, I’m so proud. But my mom passed away last night. Really needing positivity in these trying times.
MentalHealth	I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got "cured".
MentalHealth	Now all of these depressed feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, and weak.
MentalHealth	I can't fucking take it anymore... cant live, cant die, I just want to die so bad. I've been like this for years. I've tried meds, ive tried being active, having interests or whatever, but it's useless... life is useless,. A pointless labor. I just want out
MentalHealth	Lately, every morning I wake up my first thought is, “kill yourself.” I’m so tired of existence. I’m so tired.

I stood up and got in his face, and he ran into BF's room and, locking the door behind him, proceeded to break all her shit. I managed out before running back into the apartment because I'm not leaving BF alone with him. When I get back the situation has gone tits up. He's now standing in the living room with a kitchen knife to his throat saying that BF is the love of his life, and if she doesn't take him back he's going to kill himself, even intimating that the cops wouldn't believe it was a suicide, and I would go to jail for his murder.
MentalHealth	My girlfriend (24f) seems to be completely unaware of any issues here, and I've been trying to explain it to her for the last three years. She's upset nearly constantly, and when she's not, it's like walking on eggshells so as to not set her off. She's very disrespectful towards me in particular and nobody else. Not just the things she's saying, but her general demeanor all around. I think she has a genuine disorder. I know she suffers from anxiety and depression (and refuses to do anything about it), but this is personality disorder level of fucked up and I don't think I can take it anymore. My home isn't safe anymore. I don't sleep well.
